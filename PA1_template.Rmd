This is an R Markdown document created as part of the Assignment for the course 'Reporoducible Research'.This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.


```{r,echo=TRUE}
## library(data.table)
## DT_Activity <- fread(input="./activity.csv", sep=",")
DT_Activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
tot_Steps_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = DT_Activity, sum)
hist(tot_Steps_day$steps, main="Total Number of Steps Taken Each Day", col="red", xlab="Number of Steps")
## Calculate and report the mean of the total number of steps taken per day
mean(tot_Steps_day$steps)
## mean of total number of steps is : 10766.19
## Calucalte and report medain the total number of steps taken per day
median(tot_Steps_day$steps)
## median of totla number of steps is : 10765
## What is the average daily activity pattern?
## Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis ## ) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
steps_interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, DT_Activity, mean)
plot(steps_interval$interval,steps_interval$steps, type="l", xlab="Interval", ylab="Number of Steps",main="Average Daily Activity Pattern")

## Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, 
## contains the maximum number of steps?
steps_interval[which.max(steps_interval$steps),1]
## The 5 minutes intercal which contains the maximum number of steps is : 835
## Imputing missing values
## 1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)
sum(is.na(DT_Activity$steps))
## 2304 missing valuues
## 2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

## I used a strategy for filing in all of the missing values with the mean for that 5-minute interval by creating a cunction fn_interval

fn_interval <- function(interval) {
    steps_interval[steps_interval$interval == interval, ]$steps
}

## 3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
DT_activity_imputed <- DT_Activity  ## make a copy of the originaldata
count = 0  
for (i in 1:nrow(DT_activity_imputed)) {
    if (is.na(DT_activity_imputed[i, ]$steps)) {
        DT_activity_imputed[i, ]$steps <- fn_interval(DT_activity_imputed[i, ]$interval)
        count = count + 1
    }
}
cat("Total ", count, "NA values were filled.\n\r")
## Total  2304 NA values were filled.
## 4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?
tot_Steps_day_2 <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = DT_activity_imputed, sum)
hist(tot_Steps_day_2$steps, main="Total Number of Steps Taken Each Day", col="blue", xlab="Number of Steps")
## calculate the new mean and medain using the new imputed data
mean(tot_Steps_day_2$steps)
## 1076.19
median(tot_Steps_day_2$steps)
## 1076.19

## Calculate difference between mean of imputed and non-imputed data.
mean(tot_Steps_day_2$steps) - mean(tot_Steps_day$steps)
##  0
## Calculate difference between median of imputed and non-imputed data.
median(tot_Steps_day_2$steps) - median(tot_Steps_day$steps) 
## 1.188679
## calculate the total difference 
sum(tot_Steps_day_2$steps) - sum(tot_Steps_day$steps)
## 86129.51
## The difference between the imputed and non imputed mean is 0
## The difference between the imputed and non imputed median is 1.188679
## The difference between the total number of stemp between the imputed and non imputed data is 86129.51, which means there are additional 86129.51 steps in the imputed data.
## 5.Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
## 1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
DT_activity_imputed$day = ifelse(as.POSIXlt(as.Date(DT_activity_imputed$date))$wday%%6 == 
    0, "weekend", "weekday")
DT_activity_imputed$day = factor(DT_activity_imputed$day, levels = c("weekday", "weekend"))

 ## 2. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). 

steps_interval_2 = aggregate(steps ~ interval + day, DT_activity_imputed, mean)
library(lattice)
